	<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
	
	<p>The web is an essential part of life, and getting to places on the web quickly and easily is just as essential. The Toolkit provides a standard way of thinking about your institutional URI structure which make it easier for people to both remember your web addresses and also locate where they are in your web site. It also helps prepare your institution for the world of linked data by proposing a clear and concise model and vocabulary for your data, making smooth integration with other systems easier and faster.</p>

		<h2>About The Project</h2> 
		
		<p>Linking You was a project at the University of Lincoln funded by the JISC under the Infrastructure for Education and Research Programme. Its aim was to look at and make recommendations for improving the way that identifiers for .ac.uk domains are planned and managed in higher education institutions.</p>
		
		<p>The Linking You Toolkit is a collection of the outcomes of this project, and is intended as a starting point for institutions looking to better understand and manage their use of identifiers on their .ac.uk website.</p>
